// ABSTRACTION:
// Note, this is a constructor function
// Notice how calculateFinalSalary (the implentation details) is hidden
// Only exposing the functionality needed by the user (only what's required!)
// Users cannot access this variable as it's function scoped

// Example:
// Imagine variable monthly bonus wasn't defined & instead this.monthlyBonus
// Users could access this & change this! e.g. employee1.monthlybonus = 10000
// Also, imagine calculateFinalSalary wasn't a variable but instead a method
// Now, this method would be exposed to the user e.g. employee1.calculateFinalSalary
// The user doesn't need access to the implementation! 
// They ONLY need access to what is required, which is to get employee details.
