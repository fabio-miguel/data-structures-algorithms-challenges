- "Node" is a class that instantiates node object instances
- This defines a node in the Binary Search Tree
- Each node instance has a value & left & right props that point to its child nodes.

// -------------------------------------------------------------------

- "BST" is a class that when instatiated will immediately execute its constructor
- This will create a Node instance
- This instance is assigned as the root node with the initial value for the tree
- E.g. const bst = new BST(15) will create a Node object instance which is assigned as the root of the Binary Search Tree (BST)
- BST also has a count defined as 1 as it will always instatiate Node class and begin count as 1 (i.e. the root node).

// -------------------------------------------------------------------

- insert(value) method inserts values into the BST
- It instatiates a new Node object with a value passed in
- An anonymous function takes a node parameter, which when called, is the root node
- If the value entered at instatiation of new Node is less than the root node's value (node.value)...
- Nested if to check if there isn't a node assigned to node.left
- If there isn't a left node, then assign this newNode instatiation to node.left
- Else, if there is a left node, recursive call to call the function again with the current node.left as the arguement and will check left again of this left node!
- The same logic applies for the right node, but ofcourse checks if value is greater than route node
- This follows the principles of Binary Search trees where numbers less than the root are stored left and those greater are stored right.

// in-order depth first search

dfsInOrder() {
        let result = [];

        const traverse = node => {
            //if left child exists, go left again
            if (node.left) traverse(node.left)
            // capture root node value
            result.push(node.value);
            // if right child exists, go right again
            if (node.right) traverse(node.right)
            
        }

        traverse(this.root);
        return result;
    }

- Recursion is being used in the traverse function. 
- One thing to note is that recursion is hardly ever used and generally advised against.
- This is because you can create stack overflow (the stack is explained below).
- There are languages that specifically cater for recursion with tail call optimisation. Languages like Scala. 
- Now, the traverse function takes in the root node. 
- It checks if there is a node left, if true it recursively calls the function. 
- At this point, the root node is "paused" and added to the stack! 
- It is looking at the left child node (3) if there is a left child node. There is so 3 is "paused" and added to the stack.
- We have arrived at the left most node (leaf node), which is 2 and no longer meets the condition of more left nodes.
- 2 gets pushed to the result array.
- And now the stack begins to "unwind". 
- Next in the stack is the parent node (3) which gets pushed and also has a right node (12) 
- So that right node gets checked for a left node, which it doesn't then it gets pushed to result array and checked for right node which it doesn't have.
- Then, we address the next node in the stack which is 15 and the traverse function will push this and begin to do the same process on the right side.
- output: 2, 3, 12, 15 28 36 39

- Note: pre-order and post-order depth first search follow a similar logic, just in different order
- Note: also, this could have been completed without recursion, by using a while loop. But, three lines of code is readable and maintainable.
