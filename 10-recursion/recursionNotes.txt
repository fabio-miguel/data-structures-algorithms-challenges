WHAT ARE ALGORITHMS?

- Under the hood, algoritms are simply functions that programmers write.
- So, a two-line function is technically an algorithm.
- They are steps, in a process, that we take to perform a desired action. 
- Data Structures   +    Algorithms     =   Programs
-    Class {}       +    function()     =   Programs

ALGORITHM FOCUS:

- Recursion
- Sorting 
- BFS & DFS 
- Dynamic Programming 

// -------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?

- Big O and scalability of code is important, particularly as companies get larger and larger.

RECURSION 

- Recursion is technically not an algorithm but rather a concept.  
- A function calling itself based on a terminating condition.

STACK OVERFLOW

- A stack will hold recursive function calls. 
- And a "downfall" of recursion is that you have to hold onto each of these calls and remember them one by one, which can get really expensive. 
- The computer needs to allocate memory to remember things.
- Stack overflow can occur when there is no way to stop this recursive call. 
- This is why you need a base case to stop a recursive function from overflowing.
