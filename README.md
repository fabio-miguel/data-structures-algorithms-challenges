**SPOILER**
If you haven't completed the Katas before and you don't want the solutions, view the katas in the katas folder.

This repository is a collection of data structures built with JavaScript and Katas built with TDD. I have another folder with katas, but the katas in this repo are those commonly associated with data structures and common interview questions. My reasoning is... there is a reason these challenges are common interview tasks and are likely used to test knowledge of data structures and algorithms. Again, a reason why they have been organised into this repository. Educational notes and reflective thoughts are included, which may or may not be useful to you, but act as a reference point for mylsef. 

# Katas Folder
The katas have all been completed, while attempting to use strict TDD. Each test was used to drive an implementation. Tests are designed to read almost like a specification. Can you read the tests and understand what the algorithm does. This was the goal and often an overlooked aspect of TDD.
